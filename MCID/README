The Malicious Caller Identification (MCID) Invocation Support for Enterprise Networks feature enables Cisco voice gateways and Cisco Unified Call Manager to support MCID service in the PSTN. 
The recipient of a malicious call invokes MCID by pressing a configurable sequence of DTMF digits on the telephone.
After receiving the DTMF sequence the script asks the called party if they want to initiate the MCID facility request. 
When initiated the script generates the MCID request, resulting in the calling number information being forwarded to a law enforcement agency and acts accordingly upon receiving response. 
This feature is supported in both H.323 and Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) voice gateways and on all telephones. 
The ISDN interface on the Cisco gateway must use the NET5 switch type and it must be configured to operate in user-side mode(default).
